"""MCP server (stdio) that drives VRoid Studio on Windows or Hyprland.

Every tool is a thin, well-described wrapper over `mcp_vroid.driver`, which
does the actual see -> locate -> act loop: `grim` screenshots, tesseract OCR
and cv2 blob/template matching to find widgets, a `zwlr_virtual_pointer_v1`
client for the mouse and X11 XTEST for keys and the wheel.

Design notes for anyone reading the tool list:

* Coordinates are **image pixels of a capture of the VRoid window** by
  default (`space="image"`), which is exactly what `vroid_screenshot`,
  `vroid_find_text` and `vroid_find_button` hand back. Do not convert
  anything yourself.
* Nothing types or clicks unless VRoid Studio is the focused window; the
  guard lives in the driver and every acting tool re-checks it.
* The server parks VRoid on its own Hyprland workspace (9) and remembers the
  workspace the user was on, so `vroid_release` can put them back.
